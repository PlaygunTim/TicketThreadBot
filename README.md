You'll also need a postgresql instance running and set the uri in `.env` (see `.env.example` for an example)

## Running

Run `npm run build` to build to `dist/index.js` and `npm start` to run.  
`npm run go` will build and run

To deploy the slash commands run `npm run go:deploy`. - This only needs to be done once and after commands are updated

## Code Style

- Run prettier with `npm run format`
- Run linting with `npm run lint`

If you use vscode I suggest you install the [prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), and add this to your workspace's `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```
